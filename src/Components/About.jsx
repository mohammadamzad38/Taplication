        Our website helps users build their English vocabulary through
        interactive lessons. Each lesson introduces new words with meanings,
        pronunciations, and usage examples. Users can explore words by
        difficulty level and learn when to use them in real life. Engaging cards
        and modals make learning fun and easy to remember. Our mission is to
        make learning English simple, practical, and enjoyable for everyone.
